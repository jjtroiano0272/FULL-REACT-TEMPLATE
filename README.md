## Things to look out for/Notes

- [ ] In collapsing the navbar on outside click, jquery's `click()` is deprecated however, `on()` and `trigger()` don't work the same way as `click()`.
- [ ] In the navbar, everything looks like it properly handles the outside click, but be wary because this might leads to bugs down the road!
